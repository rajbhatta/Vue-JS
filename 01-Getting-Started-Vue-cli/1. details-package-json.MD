## Details inside package.json ##

### 1. What is build npm run serve or npm run build ####
Inside a Vue CLI project, @vue/cli-service installs a binary named vue-cli-service. You can access the binary directly as vue-cli-service in npm scripts, or as ./node_modules/.bin/vue-cli-service from the terminal.

This is what you will see in the package.json of a project using the default preset:
```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
    "build": "vue-cli-service build"
  }
}
```
You can invoke these scripts using either npm or Yarn:

```js
npm run serve
# OR
yarn serve
```
